# GEMINI.md — Short agent guidance for Gemini-style agents

Purpose: concise rules for Gemini or similar agents.

- Make focused, minimal changes and add tests or explicit test steps.
- Never add secrets or store personal device IPs in the repo.
- For hardware-dependent changes, open a draft PR, label `needs-hardware-test`, and request a reviewer with a test hub.
- Update `resources/version.json` and include a short `UpdateInfo` entry when releasing drivers.

When in doubt: create a draft PR and request human review.
