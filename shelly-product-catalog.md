## Notes

1. **Gen 4 multi-protocol:** Gen4 devices support WiFi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and Matter simultaneously. They can act as Zigbee routers and WiFi/BLE range extenders.

2. **BLU gateway requirement:** BLU devices require a gateway (Shelly BLU Gateway, or any Gen2+/Pro device with BLE) to connect to WiFi/cloud. Many Gen2+/Pro/Gen3/Gen4 devices can act as BLE gateways.

3. **Regional variants:** Many devices have regional variants (UL for US, ANZ for Australia/New Zealand, IT for Italy, UK for UK, DK for Denmark). These are electrically adapted but functionally identical.

4. **The Pill by Shelly:** Gen3-based compact USB-C sensor hub with WiFi + BLE. Acts as both a sensor device and a BLE gateway.

5. **CT accessories:** CT 120A and CT 400A are passive current transformers, not smart devices. They connect to the Pro 3EM family.

6. **LAN Switch:** A passive 5-port Ethernet switch (no WiFi, no smart features) for DIN rail. Included for completeness.

7. **Shelly Shutter Gen3:** Dedicated cover/shutter controller — distinct from the 2PM Gen3 in cover mode. Has a dedicated model ID (S3SH-0A2P4EU) and is optimized for motor control at 4A.

8. **Wall Display generations:** The original Wall Display (SAWD1) is Gen2-era. Wall Display X2 and X2i are newer with larger screens. The X2i upgrades to WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.0.

9. **Discontinued/legacy devices:** Some Gen 1 devices (Shelly Sense, Shelly Air, Shelly 4Pro, Shelly Color Light 255, Shelly Spot) are discontinued but still function. They remain in this catalog for completeness.

10. **Matter support:** Gen3 devices support Matter via firmware update. Gen4 devices support Matter natively. Plus (Gen2) devices do NOT support Matter.
