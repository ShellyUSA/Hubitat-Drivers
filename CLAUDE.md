# CLAUDE.md — Short agent guidance for Claude-style agents

Purpose: a concise set of rules for Claude-style agents working on this repo.

- Keep changes small, backward-compatible, and well-documented.
- Do not commit secrets or real device IPs.
- When changes require hardware testing, open a draft PR and add `needs-hardware-test` and `ai-generated` labels.
- Update `resources/version.json` and `UpdateInfo` for driver releases.

If you can't validate automatically, create a draft PR and request a human with access to a Hubitat test hub.
